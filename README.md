## 🛡️ About Me

I'm a front-end engineer with 7+ years of professional experience, focused on building clean, scalable, and performant interfaces. I predominantly work in **Web3**, helping teams build responsive, secure, and user-friendly dApps with production-grade front-end architecture.

Most of my work revolves around technologies like **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, **React Query**, and modern state management libraries like **Zustand**, **Jotai**, and **React Hook Form**. I’ve also built and maintained custom design systems using **Shadcn**, **Radix UI**, and **Headless UI**.

While front-end is my specialty, I’m comfortable going full-stack when needed—working with **Node.js**, **PostgreSQL**, and **GitHub Actions** to build and automate end-to-end systems.

I've led teams, shipped production systems, and architected reusable patterns for faster product iteration. I care deeply about developer experience, performance, and writing code that scales without getting in the way.

### Outside the Code

When I’m not deep in a codebase, I’m usually nose-deep in a book. I read a lot of classics and philosophy—Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Tolstoy, *The Art of War*—anything that wrestles with meaning, struggle, or strategy.

I’m borderline obsessive about sound—high-fidelity audio, sound design, the physics behind it. If it buzzes, hums, or resonates right, I’m interested.

I’m also into business and finance—not the startup buzzword stuff, but understanding how value flows, how markets behave, and what makes systems (and people) tick over time.

War history fascinates me too. Strategy, leadership, the psychology of conflict—it all feeds into how I think about systems, product, and even code. Everything’s a campaign, just with different weapons.

I approach engineering the same way I approach everything else: with curiosity, discipline, and a bias for building things that last.
