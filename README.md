## Hi there! 👋

I&apos;m a software engineer with over 4 years of professional experience plus another 5 years of tinkering with code and trying to build something cool (ergo projects that I hope no one will ever see again xD). I focus on Enterprise Systems, Cloud Computing and Highly Scalable Web Applications.
